              <h1>Contributors</h1>

              <h2><id="bex">Bex</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Bex Ku'uleipoina'ole Akeakamai. I am an anarcho-indigenist m&#x0101;h&#x016B; k&#x0101;naka '&#x014D;iwi and my 'aumakua-- traditional Kanaka family protector/ benevolent spirit-- is the mano (shark). I also inherit a lineage of Jewish refugees who found themselves in prime fracking territory- the mid-western United States. Each of these lenses have critically informed my work in this course on indigenous futurism as well as in my daily life. As an organizer, I have worked with anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, decolonial, indigenous, and environmental groups: most notably, Flood Wall Street. I was moved to participate in civil disobedience centering environmental rights as environmental sovereignty is inherently tied to "sustainable self-determination".

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the link to indigeneity, my family history has an arduous relationship with fracking. My father's family (not indigenous) resided in a small town in rural Illinois and survived off of well water. Through the drilling of natural gas, my families well water became contaminated, leading to various blood and bone marrow cancers and a chromosomal mutation associated with leukemia. Personally-- and politically, as the 'personal is political'-- I strive to exist in this place, space, and time in a way that honors my ancestry and work toward a future I am not ashamed of creating. As a firm believer in prefigurative living, I aim to strengthen my commitment to practicing indigenous allyship and aid in the production of resources to guide others towards such practices.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research for this project will focus on the intersections of environmental injustices and sustainable self-determination. My involvement with organizing began long before my time in New York City. During my time here, I became involved in the only felony case of Occupy Wall Street before narrowing my efforts to actions that centered indigenous struggles. I hope my contributions to our website will highlight locations of past, recent, and current organizing toward "sustainable self-determination." I understand this through Noelani Goodyear-Ka'&#x014D;pua's analysis of the phrase: "As a benchmark for indigenous mobilization, 'sustainable self-determination' shifts the focus from a state-centric entitlements discourse to practices that enable indigenous economic independence (or at least less dependence), spiritual regeneration and social health through a continuous renewal of relational obligations" (Goodyear-Ka'&#x014D;pua, 2009). Such efforts include highlighting cultural placed-based knowledge(s) within indigenous communities and mobilizing against imperialist attacks on indigenous sovereignty.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to include video and/or audio of chants and songs from organizing efforts to immerse the user in an experience that can offer a "call to action". This will be done carefully and categorically and with guidance from Lenape elders and knowledge bearers. The website will include such actions as the People's Climate March, Flood Wall Street, Decolonize This Place, and actions in relation to Standing Rock, the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline(s), and the Spectra pipeline expansion.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a participant in both the People's Climate March and Flood Wall Street, I will concentrate heavily on these two efforts. The People's Climate March serves as an impressive example of the practice of indigenous allyship. Led by indigenous peoples, hundreds-of-thousands marched toward a more sustainable future. The slightly more radical contingent of Flood Wall Street proceeded to take action the day after the momentous march. Over 3,000 protesters brought our criticisms to Wall Street in an effort to hold capitalism (and Wall Street specifically) accountable to their fueling of climate destruction. As one of the 100+ arrested at the action, I joined nine others in taking our case to trial. Being found not guilty was a massive victory on the part of our lawyers; beyond the verdict, the judge's ruling in our case has served to allow other environmental activists to cite climate change as a serious problem caused by human activity.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided by insight provided by my involvement with these environmental actions, I will argue these actions as efforts toward "sustainable self-determination:" and inherently tied to issues of indigenous sovereignty. I hope to focus attention on collective resistance drawing from legacies of indigenous resistance in Lenapehoking and challenging the omission of indigenous peoples (specifically Lenape) from current existence and futurity.</p>
              <h2><id="avi">Avi</h2>
              <p>I'm Avi Grundner, and I'm a student at NYU Gallatin, where I follow an individualized liberal arts program with a concentration in Activism and Media. I come to my work of activism as a queer, trans, Jewish, disabled white person, with the hope that my experiences can drive me to make the world better, while reminding me to be empathetic and to welcome the voices of marginalized folks. I was introduced to the Lenape history of NYC in a class in 2014, and since then I've been attempting to find ways for my work to honor and assist indigenous people with connection to this land. The first Native Studies class I took focused on worldwide indigenous media and arts, where I began mapping the indigenous history of Manhattan in a visual art project. I have been active online, using my social media spaces to build relationships with and to share the ideas and work of indigenous activists. Participating in this project has been an opportunity for me to focus on allyship as a verb, and challenged the forms of knowledge-producing I'm used to within an academic setting.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working closely with my fellow student Bex Kuuleipoinaole, I've focused my research for this project on modern indigenous art and activism surrounding issues of sovereignty and environmental rights. I'm fascinated with art's balance between personal creative output and preformative activist statement, and these spaces expand the definitions of both art and activism, showing how the two are often intertwined.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attempted Ellis Island occupation by Red Power activists in 1970 speaks to the global linkages between native nations, and reminds us of the complexity underlying colonial narratives of immigration into stolen land. Another space I've researched is where a Spectra oil pipeline flows into a vault beneath the Whitney museum. In 2015 several activist groups joined together to protest the intersection of artistic institutions and fossil fuel corporate interests. This protest event recognized the museum's role as a public space and the power of art that speaks to political issues. Protests against pipelines and other forms of environmental violence are crucial elements of solidarity with indigenous nations fighting for the rights of their land and bodies. And finally, I've worked to reexamine the ethos of Occupy Wall Street through research into the indigenous history of Wall Street, indigenous artists' participation in the movement, and alternative activist tactics that incorporate solidarity with indigenous peoples. Bex and I continue to uncover a rich history of indigenous activism in NYC, in the past and ongoing.

                   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the information I've gathered for our website will help confront any user's preconception of indigeneity as a purely historical existence, as well as galvanize possible allies into active work to support indigenous issues. The history of NYC indigenous activism is inspiring, and the city is full of resources, communities, and movements working for indigenous rights. Hopefully this work will help to highlight the power of protest and coalition. The use of physical space can disrupt the status quo, bring attention to important issues, start dialogues, and signal our lack of complacency to those in power. My and Bex's areas of research prove that New York City can be used as a space to protest its very infrastructure.

              <h2><id="domi">Dominique</h2>
              <p>I'm Dominique Lufrano, currently a senior studying Human Computer Interaction (HCI). In other words, I examine the way in which we interact with the world (other people, nature, our bodies, manmade objects) around us and try to find creative ways of employing technology to work with our body as opposed to replacing it or changing the way we use it. Working on this project has been an amazing experience of deepening what I understand as the purpose of my broader research vis-a-vis the human body, space, and time.
                   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this class, my knowledge of American indigenous culture was limited to American history textbooks and sporadic visits to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation in Arizona. My primary through high school education in a French school system in Chicago offered me a skewed version of colonization, one in which the French and other colonial powers were enlightening (and civilizing) the peoples and cultures that they destroyed and from which they stole. In their history books, the French serve as God's gift to Humanity. Of course I realized that the education system was biased, but in this class I learned about how much deeper the wounds of colonization are, and how they have grown and morphed in our neo-colonialist society.
                   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned in this course the value of constantly questioning norms and the status quo and of pursuing a lifelong goal of being a (better) ally, specifically of the Lenape because I live in their homeland. This class made me think in ways I hadn't expected, and helped me start different conversations and learn more by ask more pertinent questions when talking to my close friends who face discrimination based on their race, gender, or sexuality. I have always tried to be understanding or lend an ear to those I care about even if as a cisgendered white woman I may never understand exactly where they are coming from, but this class and especially this election has made it clear to me that listening is not enough. I have come to realize that if you believe in something, you need to listen and become actively involved in creating change.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final project, I am focusing on the Lenape trail system and bodies of water of Greenwich Village. I want to bring attention to these ponds, rivers, and streams, and trails, which still exist deep under our asphalt. According to ecologist and author of Mannahatta Dr. Eric Sanderson, "Manhattan was once as biodiverse as Yellowstone," which sounds positively bizarre knowing that the only patches of nature and wildlife are diligently managed State and City parks, and the occasional squirrel and pigeon. I will illustrate how the commercialization and commodification of Manhattan was a product of destruction of native plants (loss of forest land) and crops (corn blazing) and replacing them with farms and homes as well as hunting for profit and not food.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now lived in Manhattan for four years, I believe I know New York fairly well. For my project I'm sharing a mind palace of mine or visual-spatial memory bank of the various layers and intersections of history, moving from the Lenape to the creation of the parks. I am creating a nonlinear walking tour of my daily commute, which will describe my relation to the land, its history and its flora and fauna, as well as modern and past landmarks that changed the scenery.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind palace of Union Square this historical layering will have beavers in a marshland scene, along with the statue of George Washington, after whom the Seneca word for President came mean "town destroyer." Beavers which were common in Manhattan disappeared when their food supply (maple and aster trees) was decimated to make room for the new order. Union Square Park because it was marshy, was originally used by the colonists as a communal burial ground, until it was turned into parade grounds, and finally a public park, because the land was unsuitable for building. My visual knowledge banks along the walking tour will center on my relationship to New York and indigeneity, trying into our larger project of deconstructing colonized New York.

              <h2><id="chloe">Chloe</h2>
              <p>My name is Chloe Grey Smith and I'm a senior at Gallatin, where I study art and urban studies. My concentration deals with how art and art education can be used to teach people about urban histories, cultures, and policies, with the goal of developing activism and creating a more just and livable city. I study these topics through historical research as well as in my work as a musician, artist, craftsperson and teacher. My artistic practice involves mapping place, social/cultural life, and time, which means that I'm interested in layering and contrasting sources to develop a more complex and experiential view of my urban American environment. I'd like to use this statement as a space for giving note of where I come from and giving thanks to those who have shaped the work I do.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to this class as a direct descendant of white European colonists from the Jamestown and Plymouth colonies, knowing that my ancestors were directly involved in the colonial history of this land. This manifests as white racial privilege as well as a sort of ancestral security. I have access to a certain degree of ancestral wealth gained from the colonial system, I was born a citizen of this country, and I speak English as a first language. In learning about my family's history, I found it very interesting that I am able to uncover much information about my white colonist ancestors, whereas the other histories that shaped my family - the indigenous and immigrant narratives - seem to be lost to time. Genealogically, I am part Cherokee and part Seminole, but these ancestor's histories were not prioritized and thus I'll never be fully able to honor their memory or connect to their cultures - their lives get wrapped into the white American narrative of having some claim to this country. As an artist and student of history, I think that examining these family narratives within our culture is an important part of scholarship on American issues.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was raised in a very nontraditional school system and was lucky enough to learn a lot of history about Native activists, but I know I have a lot more to learn and I'm so thankful for the opportunity this class has given me. In the alternative community in which I was raised, I was lucky enough to be supported despite my neurological differences (what others might call a learning disability or developmental or mental illness) and isolated from many harmful aspects of American mass culture. Learning about education, and my own struggles with neurodivergence and chronic illness, I try to use my perspective and limited mobility/ability to frame my understanding of activism and provide practical feedback in working groups. In my job as an afterschool teacher of Black and Latinx children, I have tried to nurture and learn from them from my position as an outsider in their community. I've worked with and learned from many creative and dedicated activists in Argentina and the US in the realms of racial and environmental justice, mental health advocacy, and queer, trans, and women's issues. I try to bring what I have learned from them with me, both as a toolkit and as a way of honoring their work.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my independent project in this class I designed a poster series to to center the indigenous and natural history of New York in the eyes of strangers on the street. The posters teach people about the ecology of New York City, the presence and histories of the Lenape and other indigenous people, and current struggles led by indigenous people to protect their rights and our environment. For the initial stage of this project, I chose three different locations in lower Manhattan to weave together different presences and narratives from the past, present, and future. I wanted to explore in particular the connections between the environment, people, and the economy: for example, how colonial export of the Lenape's sacred tobacco plants led to chattel slavery in the US and the development of New York City as an international trade city, or how that trade let to the dredging of New York Harbor and the increased vulnerability of the city to flooding due to climate change. The posters also highlight the active roles of oppressed peoples in New York and American history, both in the past and in the present to protect our natural resources for future generations.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought my interests in studio art, mapping, and ecology to the table by researching the ecological history of New York City, reading about the native species and environments that originally filled New York - and still do! I researched Lenape language, stories, and history, and took an in-depth look at several historical maps (ranging from 1766 to 1891 to the present day) at the New York Public Library. I used these maps to note how the physical land-and-seascape of New York City has changed over the past several hundred years, which I then incorporated into the class' digital map and my own artistic project.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visually, the posters have a hand-wrought look, humanizing and exploring the complexity of history and data through delicate, layered watercolors. I focused on a sunny, flowing, low-tech design and motifs of the natural world to provide a counterpoint to the urban environment in which the posters are placed. When we transition from a mobile website to an app, a later edition of the posters will provide an opportunity to download our app for those who might not otherwise know about it, but see the posters on the street. The locations of the posters are entered into the class map so that those who want to travel to different points in Mannahatta and learn about them can search them out. </p>
              <h2><id="molly">Molly</h2>
              <p>My name is Molly Smith and I'm a third year at NYU's Gallatin School. I'm studying transnationalism, focused on problems with modern day organizations involving sovereignty, authority, and enforcement. That is, I look at how structures of global governance emerge and conduct themselves in our world. The most prominent example of this subject matter would be the current conflict surrounding Brexit, the European Union, and nationalist movements across the world. This interdisciplinary investigation requires looking at history and political structures, as well as evaluating how the conflict comes to be: often, fear of a distant or foreign ruler, and a dissolution of what makes a nation unique. In cosmopolitan New York City, it is easy to be swept up in a bubble of liberal development, with laudable ambitions of cultural sensitivity and acceptance. However, this course of study has enabled me to engage with those who feel threatened by "a faraway king," be it Brussels, New York City, or Washington, D.C.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother raised me with a lot of the lessons she herself grew up with from her father: a Cherokee man who spent most of his life in Cherokee Nation. My grandfather also had a strong influence on me growing up. Often, lessons I would learn in Christian church as a child would be supplemented with stories about my ancestry. I would hear about the land that my family has inhabited for hundreds of years, from Arkansas to Oklahoma, and learn about specific relatives, their stories, and how their stories related to not only my life, but my grandfather's life, as well as my mother's. This manner of viewing oneself as a piece of a larger, spiritual ancestry impacted me in the manner I approach the world, particularly as I engage with relationships with individuals, God, land, and even New York City.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I started my higher education in the City, I was keenly aware of the incompatibility between the knowledge imparted onto me by my ancestry and the educational system at NYU. I have developed, like many people with indigenous ancestry, a dual-perspective, what could be described as two brains or "double consciousness". My mother often says that she is "half-in" and "half-out" of her spiritual awareness, only acknowledging and interacting with Cherokee consciousness part of the time, able to completely push out imbedded cultural understandings in order to function and thrive in American society. For her, that includes trivial aspects of living, like the cliched "Indian time," where the number on the clock does not have any correlation to a necessity to be any place. It also involves more significant ways of interacting with the world; meandering stories "should" be cut short for the sake of time; facts should be presented outright; the prioritizing of data over experiences.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why? Why are indigenous ideas banned to the history books, outdated? And moreover, what can be done to reverse the genocide, of bodies and beliefs? As I've considered these questions, I've found myself peripherally engaging with Julia Parker, a Coast Miwok-Kashaya Pomo basket weaver. Parker is one of the most prominent indigenous basket weavers in the world, with her baskets featured in a variety of museums around the world. Parker often spoke about her time in boarding school, where children were completely immersed in the European-American culture, in language, appearance, and experience. This was in the pursuit of "civilizing the savages," and this mentality lingers today, as society tends to view indigenous people as artifacts rather than relevant living beings today. The effects of the Indian Schools are still felt in such severe cultural disintegration amongst indigenous groups.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New York state, one of the most prominent Indian Schools was the Thomas Asylum for Orphan and Destitute Indian Children, which operated from 1855 to 1957. It was located in the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation and considered progressive for the time because had five Native American members on its board of trustees. It's mission, however, was the same: "civilizing." This brings into question a great deal about the role of educated youth, particularly what education can look like, and should look like. The question develops further as we acknowledge the problematic nature of these schools and attempt to reach reconciliation.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paulette Regan is the Director of Research for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. The Canadian government established this commission in order to come to an understanding and healing between communities. Regan wrote Unsettling the Settler Within as an argument for the possibilities of decolonization. Decolonization, in this context, is transforming the manner we approach moving forward, from one of making excuses for the time period in which the violence occurred, to engaging with respect and honesty. Regan speaks about the belief that non-indigenous Canadians "know what is best for Indigenous people" (4). Reconciliation and embracing new knowledge moves beyond apologies for abuses that happened in indian schools, but extends to reconsidering history in a manner that addresses the root of the problem: colonialism.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has included looking into my own background with acknowledging my ancestry related to indigeneity, as well as to colonial powers. This has been academic in my concentration, but also in my personal investigation of what it means to be educated. In researching more about indian schools and the future of indigenous youth carrying knowledge, the importance of indigenous community has become even more evident. I hope that my personal experience in beginning to unpack what this means can help spur dialogue about indigenous youth, and their experience, today.

I like to take classes centered around Asian and Pacific American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and video games, and I see a lot of that reflected in my work. I come from a family with multiple backgrounds, and it has provided me with a great deal of insight in terms of how American society wants one to act versus how the personal culture allows for that person to act. For example, my mother is Japanese and she was always an outcast for her “traditional” ways in society. I think it’s important for people to understand positionality within these spaces and doing work like this and constantly questioning yourself and your approaches to this work is a crucial part. If someone who wasn’t Jewish were creating works on Judaism, I would prefer for them to do their research and receive both first hand research and second hand research.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone earlier said in our class, if you take a course that focuses on a topic that doesn’t align with your identity, or you’re in a space that is centered around people who distinctly are not you, then you should feel a specific amount of discomfort, and that is a good thing. My discomfort is approaching and writing about topics that I have never researched in an academic setting. Discomfort allows for one to constantly be questioning how one thinks and approaches work, and that is something I’ve been doing this entire course. My biggest discomfort was trying to translate terms to explain how I view Lenape (and other indigenous) games. On top of that, recreating the games was the toughest part, because I tried to recreate the games with all the specific materials and I avoided altering the game in any way to avoid any possibility of appropriation. Discomfort has driven me me to acknowledge and address my own biases and in turn learn about indigenous cultures and histories in a more nuanced way.
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people do for fun, what they use in games, when they play games, and how they play games can show a lot about one’s culture. Sometimes it even reflects what a society or culture views as impressive and valuable. What I’m focusing on in terms of contributing to the final assignment is discussing games that many indigenous cultures played or Native Americans nowadays play. I researched a few Lenape games such as maumun’dl, tititipanatuwanagi, and napahwhan. There were a few others I read up on, but I focused mostly on those and I found out that some of the games exist in other indigenous cultures: for example, tititipanatuwanagi is similar to a game played by the Chippewa. An outcome of my research is that many cultures have similar games as each other, and there must have been a great deal of communication and borrowing going on. What I found was that many games, such as maumun’dl and napahwhan, were primarily for recreation and often people would bet on games, thus bringing up the question whether or not betting on games adds another layer to the play of the game. However, other games, such as tititipanatuwanagi, were played for recreation and to enhance the skills of hunting for some people. So while games among the Lenape, and other indigenous cultures, have a strong element of leisure and enjoyment, they can also be multipurpose. Stemming from that, games created in contemporary society, like Ehdrigohr and Never Alone, serve multiple purposes. One of the purposes being an enjoyable experience for players and another is to redefine how people who play games view games. Ehdrigohr is a role playing game steering away from European elements and focusing mostly on Native American elements, such as mythology, culture, and history. While many role playing games focus on conquest and battling, Ehdrigohr centers its game on experience of the culture and mythology; instead of fighting other groups and conquering them, it focuses mostly on working together and fighting creatures, such as the shivers. Never Alone is similar, in that, it lets the player experience Iñupiat lore through the eyes of an Iñupiat child. Its focus is on the aesthetics of the setting, the story being told, and the lore surrounding the culture. Many contemporary games with Native American elements, creators, produces, and influences are a reaction to what is seen as the norm in terms of games; rather they are a pushback to what people have accepted as games. While Native American representations in video games are sparse, they often have ahistorical and offensive representations, such as a stereotype costume or terms that are not even universal to Native Amer Games, in my definition, require the following: the player(s) and the magic circle (defined by Johan Huizinga as the setting in which the player is immersed to act out what goes on during the game), and ultimately the result, which is the takeaway the player got from the game. I’m going to research what I can find out about the games and then remake the game with the materials I have now. It’s also important to know what spaces in which games were played and who played them. I’m not worried about how to turn the game into a part of the website, because I’m not interested in making it in terms of sales and popularity, but rather I want it to be as accurate as possible to show a facet of the life of many Indigenous peoples. I think leisure and games are an interesting reflection of a culture and there is plenty to learn about from just those categories.

              <p>"Though my genealogy is entangled somewhere in the murky waters of the Atlantic, the depths of the slave ships and in the re-memories of tropical bodies oozing; always oozing colonization and resistance, I intend to bring into conversation the silences of her-my-their archives as it speaks to the past, present and future of Native American realities. In other words, what does it mean if my blood does not screams African-American; yet, seeks out a type of geographic claim and reparation of North American soil even amidst it being on indigenous people's land? Perhaps, I raise this question out of urgency, since I realize that African-American blood, in particular, churns, bubbles and drips more violently on this indigenous land - North America - Turtle Island. Meanwhile, as I move forward with these queries, I intend to carve out an artistic dreaming space in my work that explores and experiments with how Lenape people and African-Americans' land futures could possibly speak to each other; in this case, I will like to see if would one screams more than the other; remain silent or both awkwardly talk disjointedly, stopping and pausing here and there."

Akiera Xavina Charles

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Afro-Caribbean queer Black femme, vegan food baddie, aspiring urban planner and architect, I hail from Bedstuy, Brooklyn, even though native to Grenada, West Indies - the Isle of Spice. Currently, I am a senior in Gallatin School of Individualized Study concentrating on "Understanding How Visionary Futurism and Spatial Geography Shapes the Afro-Diasporic Imaginary." Upon having such concentration, I have been able to think through what Black futurity would look like if colonized landscapes, sites and geographies were designed to be very Black? In other words, out of this concentration, I hope to imagine and one-day plan out Black landscapes and terrains that confront U.S. geographical history and cultural amnesia; lands and spaces that reflect the realities of those who are erased, silenced and intimately tied to them. Nevertheless, in the near future I intend on creating more community-centric dreaming labs and workshops that invite such questionings, as well as, work through and map out the dreams of marginalized individuals.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a side note, since my previous work in this course worked to re-imagine and explore the Negro Plot of 1741 to the arboreal root telling of native and non-native tree species in the Lenape Collect Pond Park area; I anticipate on exploring how my Black girl time/temporality affects how I remember and interact with Lenape time and geographic spaces. In this case, to walk would be the "Lenape way of moving," where as to commute would be the "Industrial/Colonial way of moving." Ultimately, I will show how these spatial movements inform how I re-memory the Lenape People, as well as, Black and colonized spaces on Lenapehoking.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this website and app, I have placed my Black girl temporality and time in conjunction with Lenape and African-American spatial (geographic) histories. Each of my mapping point on this website attempts to outline a new cartography (geography) of my Black girl existence; a cartography that works through these various spatial (land) temporalities - Lenape Time, African Slave Time and White Western Industrial/Colonial Time. In each point description, I will discuss whether such site or landscape is violent towards or re-affirms my "Black Girl Temporality" and spatial mobility. Particularly, I use these points to bring up a bigger conversation on how my temporality and time have dealt with the colonizing spaces of NYC and the de-colonizing work of bringing together these two geographic futures- Lenape and African-American cartographies (mappings).

              <h2><id="allen">Allen</h2>
              <p>My name is Allen Peng and I am currently a senior studying Asian/Pacific/American studies and Journalism. My experiences with indigenous people before this class had been limited to my public school education learning about Thanksgiving, Columbus, etc. A purely Eurocentric perspective that simplified, glazed over, and euphemised a lot of what happened. While I am of a minority group of people in this country, I am still privileged in many ways and wish to learn more not just about indigenous history and people during this project, but how to practice better allyship. There is always something to learn.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most interested in talking with and listening to Lenape people to share their histories through mainly audio. My portion of the project will contest narratives of colonialism with the voices of indigenous peoples actively speaking against and over those narratives.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish that, I have selected portions of text from several sources concerning the sale of Manahatta and the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline:
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Letter mentioning the sale of Manahatta by Peter Schaghen
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Netherland Monument located today in Battery Park mentioning the sale of Manahatta
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;DAPL Pipeline Facts from the Energy Transfer Website
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Report About DAPL (Only concerns areas of DAPL under government jurisdiction.)
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruling on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's civil lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Injunction did not succeed.)

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose the sale of Manahatta and the DAPL because together they demonstrate how colonialism is still alive and well today. Specifically, I am examining colonialism through the relationship between people and land. In the case of the "sale" of Manahtta, were the indigenous peoples and the Dutch on the same page regarding ownership? And for the DAPL, most of the pipeline is built on "private lands," which is why so much of it could be constructed without any third-party approval, such as that of the Standing Rock Sioux.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the judge ruled that the Standing Rock Nation had not provided evidence for the lawsuit to prevent further DAPL construction, did the Nation really not provide evidence, or was it simply evidence that did not meet the standards of the court of law? Lest we not forget how the court of law has also been used to enforce discrimination and racism.  How can the existing legal system be inherently biased against indigenous peoples?

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each portion of the texts selected seem to have an air of detachedness, a lack of empathy, mechanical, robotic. The portions of the texts will be read in monotone by a computer-generated voice--the narratives of colonialism.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, I would interview indigenous peoples living here today in New York City. The interviews would concern what they thought about the sale of Manahatta and the DAPL situation, including questions mentioned previously. Some questions may also be drawn from the specific text excerpts drawn from the previously mentioned documents. The responses would represent how indigenous people are still here today, actively fighting against colonialism and erasure.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responses and monotone text would then be combined into audio tracks for each individual. The interviewees' audio recordings would be actively contesting the monotone narratives within the tracks, changing pitch, volume, and speed.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linking it to the overall class project, each interviewee's audio track would be placed on a Google Map as a physical point. Interviewees will each choose a point in New York that is of significance to them, whether as a site of cultural growth, resistance, etc. The physical points are another way of asserting their presences today.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map only accepts video and not audio clips, but I would want to the listener to simply listen and immerse themselves within the contesting, so each video clip would have no images and only audio.

              <h2><id="jonathan">Jonathan</h2>
              <p>My name is Jonathan, I'm a sophomore at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at NYU, and I'm crafting a concentration in urban studies with an activist perspective. I'm quite interested in New York City and its indigenous past. My relationship with indigeneity was limited to the bare bones revisionism of public school Social Studies courses up until taking this class. In taking this course, I've come to grips with the fact that the town in which I grew up (Pelham, New York) was ripe with indigenous history -- much of which was hidden or unknown to me and my fellow suburbanite peers. I find this ignorance to be indicative of the privilege that comes with growing up in a relatively affluent, predominantly white suburb; even though we lived on the site of a great significance both to indigenous peoples and European colonizers (some of whom's names are memorialized through local elementary schools and parkways), we were able to completely gloss over it. Given the horrific history of colonial relations with indigenous people in this country, as well as in my town in particular, I feel a deep imperative to work towards allyship with indigenous groups. In the midst of ongoing protests in Standing Rock and Mauna Kea, it is powerful to reach into my own personal relationship with indigeneity, as well as the vast history of the Lenape in New York City and the surrounding area.

                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main interest regarding our project is mapping. As I pursued in my independent research study about the indigenous history of Split Rock Road, I am hoping to give users of our website the important and innovative opportunity of seeing modern day New York sites as they looked during the era prior to colonization. I've also added points in Pelham and the Northeast Bronx to share some of my personal experiences with indigenous sites and sites commemorating indigenous peoples. It is of the utmost importance that users understand the ways in which the Lenape used their relatively unaltered landscape in their daily lives and to their benefits. I think this is a somewhat radical act in that it forces viewers to confront the ways in which colonization has altered the landscape of New York, all while giving them a beautiful perspective into how the Lenape utilized the land and the trails they built within it. I believe that this, combined with my and my peers' personal relationships to New York, will create a visually and intellectually stimulating experience that will merge powerful personal anecdotes   I am taking charge on this by mapping a vast plethora of historic Lenape sites, sites commemorating the indigenous people of the New York Metropolitan region, and other sites relating to indigeneity in some manner. I am working extensively to organize and categorize this into discernible layers.

              <h2><id="jane">Jane</h2>
              <p>I'm Jane, a junior at Gallatin studying computer science and urban planning - I'm interested in different ways software can be used to make cities more sustainable and inclusive- places where people feel respected, happy, and safe. I love working with different kinds of technology and want to program our class website in a way that represents Lenape culture, spiritualities, and knowledges in a meaningful way. Being part of the generation that lives in the "information age," we should use all the data and tools that we can access to communicate and tackle some of the ongoing issues that our society and environment are facing. I learned a valuable lesson about how to develop tech that addresses societal issues during my previous semester when I studied abroad in the United Arab Emirates and participated in the "Smart Cities for Women: Dubai" hackathon. I was part of a team that initiated a platform for giving women and expatriates a greater voice in the Dubai government. Through my experience, I realized that, understanding and listening to the stakeholders is the greatest asset in developing a successful, meaningful application.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Korean immigrant who gained American citizenship through her parents, I have been raised with privilege and spent most of my life not being aware of it. Learning more about Lenape history has made me uncomfortable and also grateful; I am living on Lenape grounds, and I had never recognized it before this semester. I consider my father and his business in New York quite successful; however, I also have to acknowledge that his store is not just an indicator of his hard work but an opportunity that has been given through capitalism and colonization. Children of immigrants are usually told not to forget where they are from; rarely are they asked to question the whereabouts of the native people of the land that they are residing in. Through this project, I want to encourage more families of immigrants to acknowledge this discomfort and think more about decolonizing their experiences- to think not just about their heritage but also of the history of the land that they migrated to.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the research that I'm doing for our project is centered around plants that the Lenape used for medicinal purposes. The question I wanted to tackle was how cultures have used both herbal remedies and pharmaceutical drugs. Growing up, whenever I got sick my mom was always quick to hand me whatever cough syrup we had in our cabinet. However, my parents also exposed me to alternative medicines and therapies such as acupuncture, cupping, and chiropractic.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by my exposure to these different kinds of medicines, I created a storybook connecting stories of a New York City pharmacist and a Lenape healer. The book has two "beginnings" on each side of the book, and the "endings" converge in the middle. On one end of the book, the Lenape healer, who was chosen by her community for her spiritual connection and knowledge of plants, goes on a search to find the items in need when her friend's baby was sick. After praying, she finds the American elderberry (sambucus canadensis), a beautiful flower that she takes back to her village and brews. On the other side of the book, the main character is  a pharmacist working in one of the many Duane Reade stores in Manhattan. The pharmacist reaches for his customer's prescription and goes back in time to the 1970's and 1980's, where medical researchers have strived to make natural drugs but have given up because they were difficult to duplicate. These drugs have been effective, but are leading us to the end of the "pharmaceutical era," where the medicines we buy are becoming less effective. The pharmacist returns back to the present to read an article about a botanist in Georgia who has been searching for more medicinal plants to combat our use of pharmaceutical drugs.

                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my research on the relationship between herbal medicine and synthetic drugs, I looked at other plants that the Lenape utilized, and extrapolated upon that research to draw conclusions on the rights of Lenape women and the ecology of parks in New York City.
